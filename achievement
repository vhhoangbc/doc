====================

Situation/Task:

•⋅Performance problems found by customer were really hard to troubleshoot and
there were no clear mapping between their system performance with our product
performance.

•⋅The team had no idea about the limitation/expectation of the product on a
specific configuration.

•⋅Optimization level is also unclear for the team.

====================

Solution:

•⋅I set up minimum/maximum/common (simpler) configuration in our system.

•⋅I defined KPIs set for our product.

•⋅We built static models to predict theoretical/practical expectation/limitation
of our system.

•⋅We built mapping systems between our KPIs with our common customer KPIs.

•⋅I set up regression tests for verifying our models and continuous delivery

====================

Result:

•⋅Performance problems were found much earlier.

•⋅Customer performance issues were much easier to troubleshoot.

• Increased mutual understanding between custermer and the team & management when
discussing about KPI.

•⋅Discovered many optimization problems not only in our product but also in customer
system.

•⋅Release had much higher confidence.
